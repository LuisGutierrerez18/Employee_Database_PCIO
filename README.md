# Employee Database Manager
Project based on the creation of employee database

Context:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A newly founded biotechnology company desire to have an application as their first prioritized task, in which they can save the information of their employees. They have many options of programming languages to choose from, one of them being C++. They want to see the desing of their product in the programming language before mentioned in order for them to make a decision. In order for the company CEO to choose the C++ variant we have to prove that it does not only work perfectly but is optimized and meets all their criteria.  
This Projects aims to create a database system, in C++, which holds the full profile of the employee. This includes personal information such as a photo, phone number, email, illnesses etc. Also holds the record and information of the employee regarding the corporation like vacation days, sick leave and many others. This is a great way for the corporation to keep track of both types of data. Finally, incorporate biotechnology related information so the employees can access easily and rapidly to projects assigned to them.
Limitations: We lack time to make a very complete phase of the project. As a result we have a basic or beta part of the program. 
Instructions: User interactive, this means the user enters information about what is required from the program in order to work.
